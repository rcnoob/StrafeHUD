# What do the symbols mean?
## In console stats:

`|` = a clean left/right strafe

`.` = no keys, no speed gain

`$` = overlapping keys, no speed gain

`#` = overlapping while some speed gain left/right

`H` = no keys, speed gain left/right

## In HUD stats (different bc spacing)

`|` = a clean left/right strafe

`.` = no keys, no speed gain

`:` = overlapping keys, no speed gain

`;` = overlapping while some speed gain left/right

`!` = no keys, speed gain left/right
